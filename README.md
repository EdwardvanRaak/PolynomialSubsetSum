Subset Sum Problem, Polynomial Algorithm
===================

In this repo you'll find the fruits of an on-going effort to implement a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the subset sum problem.  

About this project:
The current big-O runtime is O(n^6).  (Current implementation is n^7; discovered a way to reduce complexity to n^6 while writing a proof.)

If you use the code or the algorithm, great!  Some credit will be nice.  If you break it, even better!  Contact me to let me know how you did it.  (Note: worst case at n = 200 is 200^7, which is a pretty big number.  50^7 is a pretty big number.)

UPDATE: 12/13: Justification/proof added to method.pdf.  Will edit algorithm pseudocode to outline n^6 method, expand discussion of complexity to cover the algorithm's strongly polynomial nature, and track code implementing the n^6 incarnation of the algorithm.
