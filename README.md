Subset Sum Problem, Polynomial Algorithm
===================

In this repo you'll find the fruits of an on-going effort to implement a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the subset sum problem.  

About this project:
The current big-O runtime is O(n^7).

If you use the code or the algorithm, great!  Some credit will be nice.  If you break it, even better!  Contact me to let me know how you did it.  (Note: worst case at n = 200 is 200^7, which is a pretty big number.  50^7 is a pretty big number.)

Coming soon: Improvements (will transition to BigDecimal rather than double for greater range in inputs), coherent comments and explanations, fixes when/if people break it.

UPDATE: 12/3: Began writing up formal description of algorithm in Latex; in the process, discovered a way to reduce worst-case runtime to n^7 and possibly a manner by which the complexity may be reduced further.
